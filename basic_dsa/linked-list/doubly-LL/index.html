    <p>
      Doubly Linked List is better than singly LL as it may offer us to insert
      or pop from forward as well as backward direction
    </p>
    <p>This will make it faster than singly LL</p>
    <p>
      In a doubly LL we dont need to find prev pointers which makes deletion of
      nodes easy
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubly ll needs more memory space to store extra pointers for prev node
